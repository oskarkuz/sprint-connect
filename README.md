**Issue: Module not found errors**
- Make sure you activated the virtual environment
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- Make sure you're running from the project root directory

**Issue: Database errors**
- Delete the `data/` folder and run `python -m backend.init_db` again

**Issue: Port already in use**
- For backend: `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8001` (change port)
